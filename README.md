## Problem Statement

Closed captioning displays the audio portion of a television program as text on the TV screen, providing a critical link to news, entertainment and information for individuals who are deaf or hard-of-hearing.  The importance of this project is to enhance the educational learning experience for students and others with disabilities. There should be no restrictions for simply trying to watch a video or anything related to the sorts. With subtitles/closed captions it will help eliminate this issue by being able to provide it to services that donâ€™t already provide their our closed captions. This relates to work that we have done in the class because it is building on 

### Model Accuracy Measure
The metric that we will use for our project will be transcription accuracy based on the partitioned test data set. Our baseline aim will be for at least 50% transcription accuracy on testing data for success, looking to push for much higher accuracy if we have time to do so. 


## Abstract
Nowadays, a lot of company starts to think about accessibility to not only their target audience, but outreaching to new audience as well. According to the NIHCD (National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders), approximately 15% of American adults (37.5 million) aged 18 and over report some trouble hearing. About 2 to 3 out of every 1,000 children in the USA are board with problem with hearing, with one or even both ears. This means, they won't be able to hear the tone, pick up on social clues, and other details that might required a normal person to hear from. Without having closed caption, all these important information will be lost by a viewer with hearing problem. But when a program has close caption, a viewer with hearing problem can pick up on sarcasm, understand the vibe of the crowd, and understand hwo is talking when they are not on screen.
