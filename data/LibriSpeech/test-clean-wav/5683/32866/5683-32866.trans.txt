5683-32866-0000 MISS LAKE DECLINED THE CARRIAGE TO NIGHT
5683-32866-0001 AND HE ADDED SOMETHING STILL LESS COMPLIMENTARY
5683-32866-0002 BUT DON'T THESE VERY WISE THINGS SOMETIMES TURN OUT VERY FOOLISHLY
5683-32866-0003 IN THE MEANTIME I HAD FORMED A NEW IDEA OF HER
5683-32866-0004 BY THIS TIME LORD CHELFORD AND WYLDER RETURNED AND DISGUSTED RATHER WITH MYSELF I RUMINATED ON MY WANT OF GENERAL SHIP
5683-32866-0005 AND HE MADE A LITTLE DIP OF HIS CANE TOWARDS BRANDON HALL OVER HIS SHOULDER
5683-32866-0006 YES SO THEY SAID BUT THAT WOULD I THINK HAVE BEEN WORSE
5683-32866-0007 IF A FELLOW'S BEEN A LITTLE BIT WILD HE'S BEELZEBUB AT ONCE
5683-32866-0008 BRACTON'S A VERY GOOD FELLOW I CAN ASSURE YOU
5683-32866-0009 I DON'T KNOW AND CAN'T SAY HOW YOU FINE GENTLEMEN DEFINE WICKEDNESS ONLY AS AN OBSCURE FEMALE I SPEAK ACCORDING TO MY LIGHTS AND HE IS GENERALLY THOUGHT THE WICKEDEST MAN IN THIS COUNTY
5683-32866-0010 WELL YOU KNOW RADIE WOMEN LIKE WICKED FELLOWS IT IS CONTRAST I SUPPOSE BUT THEY DO AND I'M SURE FROM WHAT BRACTON HAS SAID TO ME I KNOW HIM INTIMATELY THAT DORCAS LIKES HIM AND I CAN'T CONCEIVE WHY THEY ARE NOT MARRIED
5683-32866-0011 THEIR WALK CONTINUED SILENT FOR THE GREATER PART NEITHER WAS QUITE SATISFIED WITH THE OTHER BUT RACHEL AT LAST SAID
5683-32866-0012 NOW THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE RADIE FOR I REALLY DON'T THINK I ONCE THOUGHT OF HIM ALL THIS EVENING EXCEPT JUST WHILE WE WERE TALKING
5683-32866-0013 THERE WAS A BRIGHT MOONLIGHT BROKEN BY THE SHADOWS OF OVERHANGING BOUGHS AND WITHERED LEAVES AND THE MOTTLED LIGHTS AND SHADOWS GLIDED ODDLY ACROSS HIS PALE FEATURES
5683-32866-0014 DON'T INSULT ME STANLEY BY TALKING AGAIN AS YOU DID THIS MORNING
5683-32866-0015 WHAT I SAY IS ALTOGETHER ON YOUR OWN ACCOUNT
5683-32866-0016 MARK MY WORDS YOU'LL FIND HIM TOO STRONG FOR YOU AYE AND TOO DEEP
5683-32866-0017 I AM VERY UNEASY ABOUT IT WHATEVER IT IS I CAN'T HELP IT
5683-32866-0018 TO MY MIND THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN SOMETHING INEXPRESSIBLY AWFUL IN FAMILY FEUDS
5683-32866-0019 THE MYSTERY OF THEIR ORIGIN THEIR CAPACITY FOR EVOLVING LATENT FACULTIES OF CRIME AND THE STEADY VITALITY WITH WHICH THEY SURVIVE THE HEARSE AND SPEAK THEIR DEEP MOUTHED MALIGNITIES IN EVERY NEW BORN GENERATION HAVE ASSOCIATED THEM SOMEHOW IN MY MIND WITH A SPELL OF LIFE EXCEEDING AND DISTINCT FROM HUMAN AND A SPECIAL SATANIC ACTION
5683-32866-0020 THE FLOOR MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE SHOWED THE GREAT AGE OF THE ROOM
5683-32866-0021 MY BED WAS UNEXCEPTIONABLY COMFORTABLE BUT IN MY THEN MOOD I COULD HAVE WISHED IT A GREAT DEAL MORE MODERN
5683-32866-0022 ITS CURTAINS WERE OF THICK AND FADED TAPESTRY
5683-32866-0023 ALL THE FURNITURE BELONGED TO OTHER TIMES
5683-32866-0024 I SHAN'T TROUBLE YOU ABOUT MY TRAIN OF THOUGHTS OR FANCIES BUT I BEGAN TO FEEL VERY LIKE A GENTLEMAN IN A GHOST STORY WATCHING EXPERIMENTALLY IN A HAUNTED CHAMBER
5683-32866-0025 I DID NOT EVEN TAKE THE PRECAUTION OF SMOKING UP THE CHIMNEY
5683-32866-0026 I BOLDLY LIGHTED MY CHEROOT
5683-32866-0027 A COLD BRIGHT MOON WAS SHINING WITH CLEAR SHARP LIGHTS AND SHADOWS
5683-32866-0028 THE SOMBRE OLD TREES LIKE GIGANTIC HEARSE PLUMES BLACK AND AWFUL
5683-32866-0029 SOMEHOW I HAD GROWN NERVOUS
5683-32866-0030 A LITTLE BIT OF PLASTER TUMBLED DOWN THE CHIMNEY AND STARTLED ME CONFOUNDEDLY
