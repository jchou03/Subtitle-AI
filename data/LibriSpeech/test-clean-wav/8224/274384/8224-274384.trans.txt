8224-274384-0000 HE PASSED THROUGH HENLEY SAINT ALBANS AND CAME SO NEAR TO LONDON AS HARROW ON THE HILL
8224-274384-0001 THE SCOTTISH GENERALS AND COMMISSIONERS AFFECTED GREAT SURPRISE ON THE APPEARANCE OF THE KING AND THOUGH THEY PAID HIM ALL THE EXTERIOR RESPECT DUE TO HIS DIGNITY THEY INSTANTLY SET A GUARD UPON HIM UNDER COLOR OF PROTECTION AND MADE HIM IN REALITY A PRISONER
8224-274384-0002 THEY INFORMED THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT OF THIS UNEXPECTED INCIDENT AND ASSURED THEM THAT THEY HAD ENTERED INTO NO PRIVATE TREATY WITH THE KING
8224-274384-0003 OR HATH HE GIVEN US ANY GIFT
8224-274384-0004 AND THE MEN OF ISRAEL ANSWERED THE MEN OF JUDAH AND SAID WE HAVE TEN PARTS IN THE KING AND WE HAVE ALSO MORE RIGHT IN DAVID THAN YE WHY THEN DID YE DESPISE US THAT OUR ADVICE SHOULD NOT BE FIRST HAD IN BRINGING BACK OUR KING
8224-274384-0005 ANOTHER PREACHER AFTER REPROACHING HIM TO HIS FACE WITH HIS MISGOVERNMENT ORDERED THIS PSALM TO BE SUNG
8224-274384-0006 THE KING STOOD UP AND CALLED FOR THAT PSALM WHICH BEGINS WITH THESE WORDS
8224-274384-0007 HAVE MERCY LORD ON ME I PRAY FOR MEN WOULD ME DEVOUR
8224-274384-0008 THE GOOD NATURED AUDIENCE IN PITY TO FALLEN MAJESTY SHOWED FOR ONCE GREATER DEFERENCE TO THE KING THAN TO THE MINISTER AND SUNG THE PSALM WHICH THE FORMER HAD CALLED FOR
8224-274384-0009 THE PARLIAMENT AND THE SCOTS LAID THEIR PROPOSALS BEFORE THE KING
8224-274384-0010 BEFORE THE SETTLEMENT OF TERMS THE ADMINISTRATION MUST BE POSSESSED ENTIRELY BY THE PARLIAMENTS OF BOTH KINGDOMS AND HOW INCOMPATIBLE THAT SCHEME WITH THE LIBERTY OF THE KING IS EASILY IMAGINED
8224-274384-0011 THE ENGLISH IT IS EVIDENT HAD THEY NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY ASSURED OF RECEIVING THE KING WOULD NEVER HAVE PARTED WITH SO CONSIDERABLE A SUM AND WHILE THEY WEAKENED THEMSELVES BY THE SAME MEASURE HAVE STRENGTHENED A PEOPLE WITH WHOM THEY MUST AFTERWARDS HAVE SO MATERIAL AN INTEREST TO DISCUSS
8224-274384-0012 IF ANY STILL RETAINED RANCOR AGAINST HIM IN HIS PRESENT CONDITION THEY PASSED IN SILENCE WHILE HIS WELL WISHERS MORE GENEROUS THAN PRUDENT ACCOMPANIED HIS MARCH WITH TEARS WITH ACCLAMATIONS AND WITH PRAYERS FOR HIS SAFETY
8224-274384-0013 HIS DEATH IN THIS CONJUNCTURE WAS A PUBLIC MISFORTUNE
