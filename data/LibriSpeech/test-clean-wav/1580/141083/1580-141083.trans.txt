1580-141083-0000 I WILL ENDEAVOUR IN MY STATEMENT TO AVOID SUCH TERMS AS WOULD SERVE TO LIMIT THE EVENTS TO ANY PARTICULAR PLACE OR GIVE A CLUE AS TO THE PEOPLE CONCERNED
1580-141083-0001 I HAD ALWAYS KNOWN HIM TO BE RESTLESS IN HIS MANNER BUT ON THIS PARTICULAR OCCASION HE WAS IN SUCH A STATE OF UNCONTROLLABLE AGITATION THAT IT WAS CLEAR SOMETHING VERY UNUSUAL HAD OCCURRED
1580-141083-0002 MY FRIEND'S TEMPER HAD NOT IMPROVED SINCE HE HAD BEEN DEPRIVED OF THE CONGENIAL SURROUNDINGS OF BAKER STREET
1580-141083-0003 WITHOUT HIS SCRAPBOOKS HIS CHEMICALS AND HIS HOMELY UNTIDINESS HE WAS AN UNCOMFORTABLE MAN
1580-141083-0004 I HAD TO READ IT OVER CAREFULLY AS THE TEXT MUST BE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT
1580-141083-0005 I WAS ABSENT RATHER MORE THAN AN HOUR
1580-141083-0006 THE ONLY DUPLICATE WHICH EXISTED SO FAR AS I KNEW WAS THAT WHICH BELONGED TO MY SERVANT BANNISTER A MAN WHO HAS LOOKED AFTER MY ROOM FOR TEN YEARS AND WHOSE HONESTY IS ABSOLUTELY ABOVE SUSPICION
1580-141083-0007 THE MOMENT I LOOKED AT MY TABLE I WAS AWARE THAT SOMEONE HAD RUMMAGED AMONG MY PAPERS
1580-141083-0008 THE PROOF WAS IN THREE LONG SLIPS I HAD LEFT THEM ALL TOGETHER
1580-141083-0009 THE ALTERNATIVE WAS THAT SOMEONE PASSING HAD OBSERVED THE KEY IN THE DOOR HAD KNOWN THAT I WAS OUT AND HAD ENTERED TO LOOK AT THE PAPERS
1580-141083-0010 I GAVE HIM A LITTLE BRANDY AND LEFT HIM COLLAPSED IN A CHAIR WHILE I MADE A MOST CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE ROOM
1580-141083-0011 A BROKEN TIP OF LEAD WAS LYING THERE ALSO
1580-141083-0012 NOT ONLY THIS BUT ON THE TABLE I FOUND A SMALL BALL OF BLACK DOUGH OR CLAY WITH SPECKS OF SOMETHING WHICH LOOKS LIKE SAWDUST IN IT
1580-141083-0013 ABOVE ALL THINGS I DESIRE TO SETTLE THE MATTER QUIETLY AND DISCREETLY
1580-141083-0014 TO THE BEST OF MY BELIEF THEY WERE ROLLED UP
1580-141083-0015 DID ANYONE KNOW THAT THESE PROOFS WOULD BE THERE NO ONE SAVE THE PRINTER
1580-141083-0016 I WAS IN SUCH A HURRY TO COME TO YOU YOU LEFT YOUR DOOR OPEN
1580-141083-0017 SO IT SEEMS TO ME
1580-141083-0018 NOW MISTER SOAMES AT YOUR DISPOSAL
1580-141083-0019 ABOVE WERE THREE STUDENTS ONE ON EACH STORY
1580-141083-0020 THEN HE APPROACHED IT AND STANDING ON TIPTOE WITH HIS NECK CRANED HE LOOKED INTO THE ROOM
1580-141083-0021 THERE IS NO OPENING EXCEPT THE ONE PANE SAID OUR LEARNED GUIDE
1580-141083-0022 I AM AFRAID THERE ARE NO SIGNS HERE SAID HE
1580-141083-0023 ONE COULD HARDLY HOPE FOR ANY UPON SO DRY A DAY
1580-141083-0024 YOU LEFT HIM IN A CHAIR YOU SAY WHICH CHAIR BY THE WINDOW THERE
1580-141083-0025 THE MAN ENTERED AND TOOK THE PAPERS SHEET BY SHEET FROM THE CENTRAL TABLE
1580-141083-0026 AS A MATTER OF FACT HE COULD NOT SAID SOAMES FOR I ENTERED BY THE SIDE DOOR
1580-141083-0027 HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE HIM TO DO THAT USING EVERY POSSIBLE CONTRACTION A QUARTER OF AN HOUR NOT LESS
1580-141083-0028 THEN HE TOSSED IT DOWN AND SEIZED THE NEXT
1580-141083-0029 HE WAS IN THE MIDST OF THAT WHEN YOUR RETURN CAUSED HIM TO MAKE A VERY HURRIED RETREAT VERY HURRIED SINCE HE HAD NOT TIME TO REPLACE THE PAPERS WHICH WOULD TELL YOU THAT HE HAD BEEN THERE
1580-141083-0030 MISTER SOAMES WAS SOMEWHAT OVERWHELMED BY THIS FLOOD OF INFORMATION
1580-141083-0031 HOLMES HELD OUT A SMALL CHIP WITH THE LETTERS N N AND A SPACE OF CLEAR WOOD AFTER THEM YOU SEE
1580-141083-0032 WATSON I HAVE ALWAYS DONE YOU AN INJUSTICE THERE ARE OTHERS
1580-141083-0033 I WAS HOPING THAT IF THE PAPER ON WHICH HE WROTE WAS THIN SOME TRACE OF IT MIGHT COME THROUGH UPON THIS POLISHED SURFACE NO I SEE NOTHING
1580-141083-0034 AS HOLMES DREW THE CURTAIN I WAS AWARE FROM SOME LITTLE RIGIDITY AND ALERTNESS OF HIS ATTITUDE THAT HE WAS PREPARED FOR AN EMERGENCY
1580-141083-0035 HOLMES TURNED AWAY AND STOOPED SUDDENLY TO THE FLOOR HALLOA WHAT'S THIS
1580-141083-0036 HOLMES HELD IT OUT ON HIS OPEN PALM IN THE GLARE OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHT
1580-141083-0037 WHAT COULD HE DO HE CAUGHT UP EVERYTHING WHICH WOULD BETRAY HIM AND HE RUSHED INTO YOUR BEDROOM TO CONCEAL HIMSELF
1580-141083-0038 I UNDERSTAND YOU TO SAY THAT THERE ARE THREE STUDENTS WHO USE THIS STAIR AND ARE IN THE HABIT OF PASSING YOUR DOOR YES THERE ARE
1580-141083-0039 AND THEY ARE ALL IN FOR THIS EXAMINATION YES
1580-141083-0040 ONE HARDLY LIKES TO THROW SUSPICION WHERE THERE ARE NO PROOFS
1580-141083-0041 LET US HEAR THE SUSPICIONS I WILL LOOK AFTER THE PROOFS
1580-141083-0042 MY SCHOLAR HAS BEEN LEFT VERY POOR BUT HE IS HARD WORKING AND INDUSTRIOUS HE WILL DO WELL
1580-141083-0043 THE TOP FLOOR BELONGS TO MILES MC LAREN
1580-141083-0044 I DARE NOT GO SO FAR AS THAT BUT OF THE THREE HE IS PERHAPS THE LEAST UNLIKELY
1580-141083-0045 HE WAS STILL SUFFERING FROM THIS SUDDEN DISTURBANCE OF THE QUIET ROUTINE OF HIS LIFE
1580-141083-0046 BUT I HAVE OCCASIONALLY DONE THE SAME THING AT OTHER TIMES
1580-141083-0047 DID YOU LOOK AT THESE PAPERS ON THE TABLE
1580-141083-0048 HOW CAME YOU TO LEAVE THE KEY IN THE DOOR
1580-141083-0049 ANYONE IN THE ROOM COULD GET OUT YES SIR
1580-141083-0050 I REALLY DON'T THINK HE KNEW MUCH ABOUT IT MISTER HOLMES
1580-141083-0051 ONLY FOR A MINUTE OR SO
1580-141083-0052 OH I WOULD NOT VENTURE TO SAY SIR
1580-141083-0053 YOU HAVEN'T SEEN ANY OF THEM NO SIR
