4446-2271-0000 MAINHALL LIKED ALEXANDER BECAUSE HE WAS AN ENGINEER
4446-2271-0001 HE HAD PRECONCEIVED IDEAS ABOUT EVERYTHING AND HIS IDEA ABOUT AMERICANS WAS THAT THEY SHOULD BE ENGINEERS OR MECHANICS
4446-2271-0002 IT'S TREMENDOUSLY WELL PUT ON TOO
4446-2271-0003 IT'S BEEN ON ONLY TWO WEEKS AND I'VE BEEN HALF A DOZEN TIMES ALREADY
4446-2271-0004 DO YOU KNOW ALEXANDER MAINHALL LOOKED WITH PERPLEXITY UP INTO THE TOP OF THE HANSOM AND RUBBED HIS PINK CHEEK WITH HIS GLOVED FINGER DO YOU KNOW I SOMETIMES THINK OF TAKING TO CRITICISM SERIOUSLY MYSELF
4446-2271-0005 SHE SAVES HER HAND TOO SHE'S AT HER BEST IN THE SECOND ACT
4446-2271-0006 HE'S BEEN WANTING TO MARRY HILDA THESE THREE YEARS AND MORE
4446-2271-0007 SHE DOESN'T TAKE UP WITH ANYBODY YOU KNOW
4446-2271-0008 IRENE BURGOYNE ONE OF HER FAMILY TOLD ME IN CONFIDENCE THAT THERE WAS A ROMANCE SOMEWHERE BACK IN THE BEGINNING
4446-2271-0009 MAINHALL VOUCHED FOR HER CONSTANCY WITH A LOFTINESS THAT MADE ALEXANDER SMILE EVEN WHILE A KIND OF RAPID EXCITEMENT WAS TINGLING THROUGH HIM
4446-2271-0010 HE'S ANOTHER WHO'S AWFULLY KEEN ABOUT HER LET ME INTRODUCE YOU
4446-2271-0011 SIR HARRY TOWNE MISTER BARTLEY ALEXANDER THE AMERICAN ENGINEER
4446-2271-0012 I SAY SIR HARRY THE LITTLE GIRL'S GOING FAMOUSLY TO NIGHT ISN'T SHE
4446-2271-0013 DO YOU KNOW I THOUGHT THE DANCE A BIT CONSCIOUS TO NIGHT FOR THE FIRST TIME
4446-2271-0014 WESTMERE AND I WERE BACK AFTER THE FIRST ACT AND WE THOUGHT SHE SEEMED QUITE UNCERTAIN OF HERSELF
4446-2271-0015 A LITTLE ATTACK OF NERVES POSSIBLY
4446-2271-0016 HE WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL A KEEN INTEREST IN THE SLENDER BAREFOOT DONKEY GIRL WHO SLIPPED IN AND OUT OF THE PLAY SINGING LIKE SOME ONE WINDING THROUGH A HILLY FIELD
4446-2271-0017 ONE NIGHT WHEN HE AND WINIFRED WERE SITTING TOGETHER ON THE BRIDGE HE TOLD HER THAT THINGS HAD HAPPENED WHILE HE WAS STUDYING ABROAD THAT HE WAS SORRY FOR ONE THING IN PARTICULAR AND HE ASKED HER WHETHER SHE THOUGHT SHE OUGHT TO KNOW ABOUT THEM
4446-2271-0018 SHE CONSIDERED A MOMENT AND THEN SAID NO I THINK NOT THOUGH I AM GLAD YOU ASK ME
4446-2271-0019 AFTER THAT IT WAS EASY TO FORGET ACTUALLY TO FORGET
4446-2271-0020 OF COURSE HE REFLECTED SHE ALWAYS HAD THAT COMBINATION OF SOMETHING HOMELY AND SENSIBLE AND SOMETHING UTTERLY WILD AND DAFT
4446-2271-0021 SHE MUST CARE ABOUT THE THEATRE A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN SHE USED TO
4446-2271-0022 I'M GLAD SHE'S HELD HER OWN SINCE
4446-2271-0023 AFTER ALL WE WERE AWFULLY YOUNG
4446-2271-0024 I SHOULDN'T WONDER IF SHE COULD LAUGH ABOUT IT WITH ME NOW
