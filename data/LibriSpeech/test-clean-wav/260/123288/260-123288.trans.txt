260-123288-0000 THE ROARINGS BECOME LOST IN THE DISTANCE
260-123288-0001 THE WEATHER IF WE MAY USE THAT TERM WILL CHANGE BEFORE LONG
260-123288-0002 THE ATMOSPHERE IS CHARGED WITH VAPOURS PERVADED WITH THE ELECTRICITY GENERATED BY THE EVAPORATION OF SALINE WATERS
260-123288-0003 THE ELECTRIC LIGHT CAN SCARCELY PENETRATE THROUGH THE DENSE CURTAIN WHICH HAS DROPPED OVER THE THEATRE ON WHICH THE BATTLE OF THE ELEMENTS IS ABOUT TO BE WAGED
260-123288-0004 THE AIR IS HEAVY THE SEA IS CALM
260-123288-0005 FROM TIME TO TIME A FLEECY TUFT OF MIST WITH YET SOME GLEAMING LIGHT LEFT UPON IT DROPS DOWN UPON THE DENSE FLOOR OF GREY AND LOSES ITSELF IN THE OPAQUE AND IMPENETRABLE MASS
260-123288-0006 THE ATMOSPHERE IS EVIDENTLY CHARGED AND SURCHARGED WITH ELECTRICITY
260-123288-0007 THE WIND NEVER LULLS BUT TO ACQUIRE INCREASED STRENGTH THE VAST BANK OF HEAVY CLOUDS IS A HUGE RESERVOIR OF FEARFUL WINDY GUSTS AND RUSHING STORMS
260-123288-0008 THERE'S A HEAVY STORM COMING ON I CRIED POINTING TOWARDS THE HORIZON
260-123288-0009 THOSE CLOUDS SEEM AS IF THEY WERE GOING TO CRUSH THE SEA
260-123288-0010 ON THE MAST ALREADY I SEE THE LIGHT PLAY OF A LAMBENT SAINT ELMO'S FIRE THE OUTSTRETCHED SAIL CATCHES NOT A BREATH OF WIND AND HANGS LIKE A SHEET OF LEAD
260-123288-0011 BUT IF WE HAVE NOW CEASED TO ADVANCE WHY DO WE YET LEAVE THAT SAIL LOOSE WHICH AT THE FIRST SHOCK OF THE TEMPEST MAY CAPSIZE US IN A MOMENT
260-123288-0012 THAT WILL BE SAFEST NO NO NEVER
260-123288-0013 THE PILED UP VAPOURS CONDENSE INTO WATER AND THE AIR PUT INTO VIOLENT ACTION TO SUPPLY THE VACUUM LEFT BY THE CONDENSATION OF THE MISTS ROUSES ITSELF INTO A WHIRLWIND
260-123288-0014 HANS STIRS NOT
260-123288-0015 FROM THE UNDER SURFACE OF THE CLOUDS THERE ARE CONTINUAL EMISSIONS OF LURID LIGHT ELECTRIC MATTER IS IN CONTINUAL EVOLUTION FROM THEIR COMPONENT MOLECULES THE GASEOUS ELEMENTS OF THE AIR NEED TO BE SLAKED WITH MOISTURE FOR INNUMERABLE COLUMNS OF WATER RUSH UPWARDS INTO THE AIR AND FALL BACK AGAIN IN WHITE FOAM
260-123288-0016 I REFER TO THE THERMOMETER IT INDICATES THE FIGURE IS OBLITERATED
260-123288-0017 IS THE ATMOSPHERIC CONDITION HAVING ONCE REACHED THIS DENSITY TO BECOME FINAL
260-123288-0018 THE RAFT BEARS ON STILL TO THE SOUTH EAST
260-123288-0019 AT NOON THE VIOLENCE OF THE STORM REDOUBLES
260-123288-0020 EACH OF US IS LASHED TO SOME PART OF THE RAFT
260-123288-0021 THE WAVES RISE ABOVE OUR HEADS
260-123288-0022 THEY SEEM TO BE WE ARE LOST BUT I AM NOT SURE
260-123288-0023 HE NODS HIS CONSENT
260-123288-0024 THE FIREBALL HALF OF IT WHITE HALF AZURE BLUE AND THE SIZE OF A TEN INCH SHELL MOVED SLOWLY ABOUT THE RAFT BUT REVOLVING ON ITS OWN AXIS WITH ASTONISHING VELOCITY AS IF WHIPPED ROUND BY THE FORCE OF THE WHIRLWIND
260-123288-0025 HERE IT COMES THERE IT GLIDES NOW IT IS UP THE RAGGED STUMP OF THE MAST THENCE IT LIGHTLY LEAPS ON THE PROVISION BAG DESCENDS WITH A LIGHT BOUND AND JUST SKIMS THE POWDER MAGAZINE HORRIBLE
260-123288-0026 WE SHALL BE BLOWN UP BUT NO THE DAZZLING DISK OF MYSTERIOUS LIGHT NIMBLY LEAPS ASIDE IT APPROACHES HANS WHO FIXES HIS BLUE EYE UPON IT STEADILY IT THREATENS THE HEAD OF MY UNCLE WHO FALLS UPON HIS KNEES WITH HIS HEAD DOWN TO AVOID IT
260-123288-0027 A SUFFOCATING SMELL OF NITROGEN FILLS THE AIR IT ENTERS THE THROAT IT FILLS THE LUNGS
260-123288-0028 WE SUFFER STIFLING PAINS
