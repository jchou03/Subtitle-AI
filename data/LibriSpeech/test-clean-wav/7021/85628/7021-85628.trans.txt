7021-85628-0000 BUT ANDERS CARED NOTHING ABOUT THAT
7021-85628-0001 HE MADE A BOW SO DEEP THAT HIS BACK CAME NEAR BREAKING AND HE WAS DUMBFOUNDED I CAN TELL YOU WHEN HE SAW IT WAS NOBODY BUT ANDERS
7021-85628-0002 HE WAS SUCH A BIG BOY THAT HE WORE HIGH BOOTS AND CARRIED A JACK KNIFE
7021-85628-0003 NOW THIS KNIFE WAS A SPLENDID ONE THOUGH HALF THE BLADE WAS GONE AND THE HANDLE WAS A LITTLE CRACKED AND ANDERS KNEW THAT ONE IS ALMOST A MAN AS SOON AS ONE HAS A JACK KNIFE
7021-85628-0004 YES WHY NOT THOUGHT ANDERS
7021-85628-0005 SEEING THAT I AM SO FINE I MAY AS WELL GO AND VISIT THE KING
7021-85628-0006 I AM GOING TO THE COURT BALL ANSWERED ANDERS
7021-85628-0007 AND SHE TOOK ANDERS HAND AND WALKED WITH HIM UP THE BROAD MARBLE STAIRS WHERE SOLDIERS WERE POSTED AT EVERY THIRD STEP AND THROUGH THE MAGNIFICENT HALLS WHERE COURTIERS IN SILK AND VELVET STOOD BOWING WHEREVER HE WENT
7021-85628-0008 FOR LIKE AS NOT THEY MUST HAVE THOUGHT HIM A PRINCE WHEN THEY SAW HIS FINE CAP
7021-85628-0009 AT THE FARTHER END OF THE LARGEST HALL A TABLE WAS SET WITH GOLDEN CUPS AND GOLDEN PLATES IN LONG ROWS
7021-85628-0010 ON HUGE SILVER PLATTERS WERE PYRAMIDS OF TARTS AND CAKES AND RED WINE SPARKLED IN GLITTERING DECANTERS
7021-85628-0011 THE PRINCESS SAT DOWN UNDER A BLUE CANOPY WITH BOUQUETS OF ROSES AND SHE LET ANDERS SIT IN A GOLDEN CHAIR BY HER SIDE
7021-85628-0012 BUT YOU MUST NOT EAT WITH YOUR CAP ON YOUR HEAD SHE SAID AND WAS GOING TO TAKE IT OFF
7021-85628-0013 THE PRINCESS CERTAINLY WAS BEAUTIFUL AND HE WOULD HAVE DEARLY LIKED TO BE KISSED BY HER BUT THE CAP WHICH HIS MOTHER HAD MADE HE WOULD NOT GIVE UP ON ANY CONDITION
7021-85628-0014 HE ONLY SHOOK HIS HEAD
7021-85628-0015 WELL BUT NOW SAID THE PRINCESS AND SHE FILLED HIS POCKETS WITH CAKES AND PUT HER OWN HEAVY GOLD CHAIN AROUND HIS NECK AND BENT DOWN AND KISSED HIM
7021-85628-0016 THAT IS A VERY FINE CAP YOU HAVE HE SAID
7021-85628-0017 SO IT IS SAID ANDERS
7021-85628-0018 AND IT IS MADE OF MOTHER'S BEST YARN AND SHE KNITTED IT HERSELF AND EVERYBODY WANTS TO GET IT AWAY FROM ME
7021-85628-0019 WITH ONE JUMP ANDERS GOT OUT OF HIS CHAIR
7021-85628-0020 HE DARTED LIKE AN ARROW THROUGH ALL THE HALLS DOWN ALL THE STAIRS AND ACROSS THE YARD
7021-85628-0021 HE STILL HELD ON TO IT WITH BOTH HANDS AS HE RUSHED INTO HIS MOTHER'S COTTAGE
7021-85628-0022 AND ALL HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS STOOD ROUND AND LISTENED WITH THEIR MOUTHS OPEN
7021-85628-0023 BUT WHEN HIS BIG BROTHER HEARD THAT HE HAD REFUSED TO GIVE HIS CAP FOR A KING'S GOLDEN CROWN HE SAID THAT ANDERS WAS A STUPID
7021-85628-0024 ANDERS FACE GREW RED
7021-85628-0025 BUT HIS MOTHER HUGGED HIM CLOSE
7021-85628-0026 NO MY LITTLE SON SHE SAID
7021-85628-0027 IF YOU DRESSED IN SILK AND GOLD FROM TOP TO TOE YOU COULD NOT LOOK ANY NICER THAN IN YOUR LITTLE RED CAP
