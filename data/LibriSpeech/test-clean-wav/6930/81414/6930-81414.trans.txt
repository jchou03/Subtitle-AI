6930-81414-0000 NO WORDS WERE SPOKEN NO LANGUAGE WAS UTTERED SAVE THAT OF WAILING AND HISSING AND THAT SOMEHOW WAS INDISTINCT AS IF IT EXISTED IN FANCY AND NOT IN REALITY
6930-81414-0001 I HEARD A NOISE BEHIND I TURNED AND SAW KAFFAR HIS BLACK EYES SHINING WHILE IN HIS HAND HE HELD A GLEAMING KNIFE HE LIFTED IT ABOVE HIS HEAD AS IF TO STRIKE BUT I HAD THE STRENGTH OF TEN MEN AND I HURLED HIM FROM ME
6930-81414-0002 ONWARD SAID A DISTANT VOICE
6930-81414-0003 NO SOUND BROKE THE STILLNESS OF THE NIGHT
6930-81414-0004 THE STORY OF ITS EVIL INFLUENCE CAME BACK TO ME AND IN MY BEWILDERED CONDITION I WONDERED WHETHER THERE WAS NOT SOME TRUTH IN WHAT HAD BEEN SAID
6930-81414-0005 WHAT WAS THAT
6930-81414-0006 WHAT THEN A HUMAN HAND LARGE AND SHAPELY APPEARED DISTINCTLY ON THE SURFACE OF THE POND
6930-81414-0007 NOTHING MORE NOT EVEN THE WRIST TO WHICH IT MIGHT BE ATTACHED
6930-81414-0008 IT DID NOT BECKON OR INDEED MOVE AT ALL IT WAS AS STILL AS THE HAND OF DEATH
6930-81414-0009 I AWOKE TO CONSCIOUSNESS FIGHTING AT FIRST IT SEEMED AS IF I WAS FIGHTING WITH A PHANTOM BUT GRADUALLY MY OPPONENT BECAME MORE REAL TO ME IT WAS KAFFAR
6930-81414-0010 A SOUND OF VOICES A FLASH OF LIGHT
6930-81414-0011 A FEELING OF FREEDOM AND I WAS AWAKE WHERE
6930-81414-0012 SAID ANOTHER VOICE WHICH I RECOGNIZED AS VOLTAIRE'S KAFFAR
6930-81414-0013 I HAD SCARCELY KNOWN WHAT I HAD BEEN SAYING OR DOING UP TO THIS TIME BUT AS HE SPOKE I LOOKED AT MY HAND
6930-81414-0014 IN THE LIGHT OF THE MOON I SAW A KNIFE RED WITH BLOOD AND MY HAND TOO WAS ALSO DISCOLOURED
6930-81414-0015 I DO NOT KNOW I AM DAZED BEWILDERED
6930-81414-0016 BUT THAT IS KAFFAR'S KNIFE
6930-81414-0017 I KNOW HE HAD IT THIS VERY EVENING
6930-81414-0018 I REMEMBER SAYING HAVE WE BEEN TOGETHER
6930-81414-0019 VOLTAIRE PICKED UP SOMETHING FROM THE GROUND AND LOOKED AT IT
6930-81414-0020 I SAY YOU DO KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS AND YOU MUST TELL US
6930-81414-0021 A TERRIBLE THOUGHT FLASHED INTO MY MIND
6930-81414-0022 I HAD AGAIN BEEN ACTING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THIS MAN'S POWER
6930-81414-0023 PERCHANCE TOO KAFFAR'S DEATH MIGHT SERVE HIM IN GOOD STEAD
6930-81414-0024 MY TONGUE REFUSED TO ARTICULATE MY POWER OF SPEECH LEFT ME
6930-81414-0025 MY POSITION WAS TOO TERRIBLE
6930-81414-0026 MY OVERWROUGHT NERVES YIELDED AT LAST
6930-81414-0027 FOR SOME TIME AFTER THAT I REMEMBERED NOTHING DISTINCTLY
