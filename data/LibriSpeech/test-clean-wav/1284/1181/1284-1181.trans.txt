1284-1181-0000 OJO EXAMINED THIS CURIOUS CONTRIVANCE WITH WONDER
1284-1181-0001 MARGOLOTTE HAD FIRST MADE THE GIRL'S FORM FROM THE PATCHWORK QUILT AND THEN SHE HAD DRESSED IT WITH A PATCHWORK SKIRT AND AN APRON WITH POCKETS IN IT USING THE SAME GAY MATERIAL THROUGHOUT
1284-1181-0002 THE HEAD OF THE PATCHWORK GIRL WAS THE MOST CURIOUS PART OF HER
1284-1181-0003 THE HAIR WAS OF BROWN YARN AND HUNG DOWN ON HER NECK IN SEVERAL NEAT BRAIDS
1284-1181-0004 GOLD IS THE MOST COMMON METAL IN THE LAND OF OZ AND IS USED FOR MANY PURPOSES BECAUSE IT IS SOFT AND PLIABLE
1284-1181-0005 NO I FORGOT ALL ABOUT THE BRAINS EXCLAIMED THE WOMAN
1284-1181-0006 WELL THAT MAY BE TRUE AGREED MARGOLOTTE BUT ON THE CONTRARY A SERVANT WITH TOO MUCH BRAINS IS SURE TO BECOME INDEPENDENT AND HIGH AND MIGHTY AND FEEL ABOVE HER WORK
1284-1181-0007 SHE POURED INTO THE DISH A QUANTITY FROM EACH OF THESE BOTTLES
1284-1181-0008 I THINK THAT WILL DO SHE CONTINUED FOR THE OTHER QUALITIES ARE NOT NEEDED IN A SERVANT
1284-1181-0009 SHE RAN TO HER HUSBAND'S SIDE AT ONCE AND HELPED HIM LIFT THE FOUR KETTLES FROM THE FIRE
1284-1181-0010 THEIR CONTENTS HAD ALL BOILED AWAY LEAVING IN THE BOTTOM OF EACH KETTLE A FEW GRAINS OF FINE WHITE POWDER
1284-1181-0011 VERY CAREFULLY THE MAGICIAN REMOVED THIS POWDER PLACING IT ALL TOGETHER IN A GOLDEN DISH WHERE HE MIXED IT WITH A GOLDEN SPOON
1284-1181-0012 NO ONE SAW HIM DO THIS FOR ALL WERE LOOKING AT THE POWDER OF LIFE BUT SOON THE WOMAN REMEMBERED WHAT SHE HAD BEEN DOING AND CAME BACK TO THE CUPBOARD
1284-1181-0013 OJO BECAME A BIT UNEASY AT THIS FOR HE HAD ALREADY PUT QUITE A LOT OF THE CLEVERNESS POWDER IN THE DISH BUT HE DARED NOT INTERFERE AND SO HE COMFORTED HIMSELF WITH THE THOUGHT THAT ONE CANNOT HAVE TOO MUCH CLEVERNESS
1284-1181-0014 HE SELECTED A SMALL GOLD BOTTLE WITH A PEPPER BOX TOP SO THAT THE POWDER MIGHT BE SPRINKLED ON ANY OBJECT THROUGH THE SMALL HOLES
1284-1181-0015 MOST PEOPLE TALK TOO MUCH SO IT IS A RELIEF TO FIND ONE WHO TALKS TOO LITTLE
1284-1181-0016 I AM NOT ALLOWED TO PERFORM MAGIC EXCEPT FOR MY OWN AMUSEMENT HE TOLD HIS VISITORS AS HE LIGHTED A PIPE WITH A CROOKED STEM AND BEGAN TO SMOKE
1284-1181-0017 THE WIZARD OF OZ WHO USED TO BE A HUMBUG AND KNEW NO MAGIC AT ALL HAS BEEN TAKING LESSONS OF GLINDA AND I'M TOLD HE IS GETTING TO BE A PRETTY GOOD WIZARD BUT HE IS MERELY THE ASSISTANT OF THE GREAT SORCERESS
1284-1181-0018 IT TRULY IS ASSERTED THE MAGICIAN
1284-1181-0019 I NOW USE THEM AS ORNAMENTAL STATUARY IN MY GARDEN
1284-1181-0020 DEAR ME WHAT A CHATTERBOX YOU'RE GETTING TO BE UNC REMARKED THE MAGICIAN WHO WAS PLEASED WITH THE COMPLIMENT
1284-1181-0021 ASKED THE VOICE IN SCORNFUL ACCENTS
