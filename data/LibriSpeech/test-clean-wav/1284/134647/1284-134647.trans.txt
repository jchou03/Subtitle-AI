1284-134647-0000 THE GRATEFUL APPLAUSE OF THE CLERGY HAS CONSECRATED THE MEMORY OF A PRINCE WHO INDULGED THEIR PASSIONS AND PROMOTED THEIR INTEREST
1284-134647-0001 THE EDICT OF MILAN THE GREAT CHARTER OF TOLERATION HAD CONFIRMED TO EACH INDIVIDUAL OF THE ROMAN WORLD THE PRIVILEGE OF CHOOSING AND PROFESSING HIS OWN RELIGION
1284-134647-0002 BUT THIS INESTIMABLE PRIVILEGE WAS SOON VIOLATED WITH THE KNOWLEDGE OF TRUTH THE EMPEROR IMBIBED THE MAXIMS OF PERSECUTION AND THE SECTS WHICH DISSENTED FROM THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WERE AFFLICTED AND OPPRESSED BY THE TRIUMPH OF CHRISTIANITY
1284-134647-0003 CONSTANTINE EASILY BELIEVED THAT THE HERETICS WHO PRESUMED TO DISPUTE HIS OPINIONS OR TO OPPOSE HIS COMMANDS WERE GUILTY OF THE MOST ABSURD AND CRIMINAL OBSTINACY AND THAT A SEASONABLE APPLICATION OF MODERATE SEVERITIES MIGHT SAVE THOSE UNHAPPY MEN FROM THE DANGER OF AN EVERLASTING CONDEMNATION
1284-134647-0004 SOME OF THE PENAL REGULATIONS WERE COPIED FROM THE EDICTS OF DIOCLETIAN AND THIS METHOD OF CONVERSION WAS APPLAUDED BY THE SAME BISHOPS WHO HAD FELT THE HAND OF OPPRESSION AND PLEADED FOR THE RIGHTS OF HUMANITY
1284-134647-0005 THEY ASSERTED WITH CONFIDENCE AND ALMOST WITH EXULTATION THAT THE APOSTOLICAL SUCCESSION WAS INTERRUPTED THAT ALL THE BISHOPS OF EUROPE AND ASIA WERE INFECTED BY THE CONTAGION OF GUILT AND SCHISM AND THAT THE PREROGATIVES OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WERE CONFINED TO THE CHOSEN PORTION OF THE AFRICAN BELIEVERS WHO ALONE HAD PRESERVED INVIOLATE THE INTEGRITY OF THEIR FAITH AND DISCIPLINE
1284-134647-0006 BISHOPS VIRGINS AND EVEN SPOTLESS INFANTS WERE SUBJECTED TO THE DISGRACE OF A PUBLIC PENANCE BEFORE THEY COULD BE ADMITTED TO THE COMMUNION OF THE DONATISTS
1284-134647-0007 PROSCRIBED BY THE CIVIL AND ECCLESIASTICAL POWERS OF THE EMPIRE THE DONATISTS STILL MAINTAINED IN SOME PROVINCES PARTICULARLY IN NUMIDIA THEIR SUPERIOR NUMBERS AND FOUR HUNDRED BISHOPS ACKNOWLEDGED THE JURISDICTION OF THEIR PRIMATE
