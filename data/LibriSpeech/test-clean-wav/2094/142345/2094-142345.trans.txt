2094-142345-0000 IT IS A VERY FINE OLD PLACE OF RED BRICK SOFTENED BY A PALE POWDERY LICHEN WHICH HAS DISPERSED ITSELF WITH HAPPY IRREGULARITY SO AS TO BRING THE RED BRICK INTO TERMS OF FRIENDLY COMPANIONSHIP WITH THE LIMESTONE ORNAMENTS SURROUNDING THE THREE GABLES THE WINDOWS AND THE DOOR PLACE
2094-142345-0001 BUT THE WINDOWS ARE PATCHED WITH WOODEN PANES AND THE DOOR I THINK IS LIKE THE GATE IT IS NEVER OPENED
2094-142345-0002 FOR IT IS A SOLID HEAVY HANDSOME DOOR AND MUST ONCE HAVE BEEN IN THE HABIT OF SHUTTING WITH A SONOROUS BANG BEHIND A LIVERIED LACKEY WHO HAD JUST SEEN HIS MASTER AND MISTRESS OFF THE GROUNDS IN A CARRIAGE AND PAIR
2094-142345-0003 A LARGE OPEN FIREPLACE WITH RUSTY DOGS IN IT AND A BARE BOARDED FLOOR AT THE FAR END FLEECES OF WOOL STACKED UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR SOME EMPTY CORN BAGS
2094-142345-0004 AND WHAT THROUGH THE LEFT HAND WINDOW
2094-142345-0005 SEVERAL CLOTHES HORSES A PILLION A SPINNING WHEEL AND AN OLD BOX WIDE OPEN AND STUFFED FULL OF COLOURED RAGS
2094-142345-0006 AT THE EDGE OF THIS BOX THERE LIES A GREAT WOODEN DOLL WHICH SO FAR AS MUTILATION IS CONCERNED BEARS A STRONG RESEMBLANCE TO THE FINEST GREEK SCULPTURE AND ESPECIALLY IN THE TOTAL LOSS OF ITS NOSE
2094-142345-0007 THE HISTORY OF THE HOUSE IS PLAIN NOW
2094-142345-0008 BUT THERE IS ALWAYS A STRONGER SENSE OF LIFE WHEN THE SUN IS BRILLIANT AFTER RAIN AND NOW HE IS POURING DOWN HIS BEAMS AND MAKING SPARKLES AMONG THE WET STRAW AND LIGHTING UP EVERY PATCH OF VIVID GREEN MOSS ON THE RED TILES OF THE COW SHED AND TURNING EVEN THE MUDDY WATER THAT IS HURRYING ALONG THE CHANNEL TO THE DRAIN INTO A MIRROR FOR THE YELLOW BILLED DUCKS WHO ARE SEIZING THE OPPORTUNITY OF GETTING A DRINK WITH AS MUCH BODY IN IT AS POSSIBLE
2094-142345-0009 FOR THE GREAT BARN DOORS ARE THROWN WIDE OPEN AND MEN ARE BUSY THERE MENDING THE HARNESS UNDER THE SUPERINTENDENCE OF MISTER GOBY THE WHITTAW OTHERWISE SADDLER WHO ENTERTAINS THEM WITH THE LATEST TREDDLESTON GOSSIP
2094-142345-0010 HETTY SORREL OFTEN TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY WHEN HER AUNT'S BACK WAS TURNED OF LOOKING AT THE PLEASING REFLECTION OF HERSELF IN THOSE POLISHED SURFACES FOR THE OAK TABLE WAS USUALLY TURNED UP LIKE A SCREEN AND WAS MORE FOR ORNAMENT THAN FOR USE AND SHE COULD SEE HERSELF SOMETIMES IN THE GREAT ROUND PEWTER DISHES THAT WERE RANGED ON THE SHELVES ABOVE THE LONG DEAL DINNER TABLE OR IN THE HOBS OF THE GRATE WHICH ALWAYS SHONE LIKE JASPER
2094-142345-0011 DO NOT SUPPOSE HOWEVER THAT MISSUS POYSER WAS ELDERLY OR SHREWISH IN HER APPEARANCE SHE WAS A GOOD LOOKING WOMAN NOT MORE THAN EIGHT AND THIRTY OF FAIR COMPLEXION AND SANDY HAIR WELL SHAPEN LIGHT FOOTED
2094-142345-0012 THE FAMILY LIKENESS BETWEEN HER AND HER NIECE DINAH MORRIS WITH THE CONTRAST BETWEEN HER KEENNESS AND DINAH'S SERAPHIC GENTLENESS OF EXPRESSION MIGHT HAVE SERVED A PAINTER AS AN EXCELLENT SUGGESTION FOR A MARTHA AND MARY
2094-142345-0013 HER TONGUE WAS NOT LESS KEEN THAN HER EYE AND WHENEVER A DAMSEL CAME WITHIN EARSHOT SEEMED TO TAKE UP AN UNFINISHED LECTURE AS A BARREL ORGAN TAKES UP A TUNE PRECISELY AT THE POINT WHERE IT HAD LEFT OFF
2094-142345-0014 THE FACT THAT IT WAS CHURNING DAY WAS ANOTHER REASON WHY IT WAS INCONVENIENT TO HAVE THE WHITTAWS AND WHY CONSEQUENTLY MISSUS POYSER SHOULD SCOLD MOLLY THE HOUSEMAID WITH UNUSUAL SEVERITY
2094-142345-0015 TO ALL APPEARANCE MOLLY HAD GOT THROUGH HER AFTER DINNER WORK IN AN EXEMPLARY MANNER HAD CLEANED HERSELF WITH GREAT DISPATCH AND NOW CAME TO ASK SUBMISSIVELY IF SHE SHOULD SIT DOWN TO HER SPINNING TILL MILKING TIME
2094-142345-0016 SPINNING INDEED
2094-142345-0017 I NEVER KNEW YOUR EQUALS FOR GALLOWSNESS
2094-142345-0018 WHO TAUGHT YOU TO SCRUB A FLOOR I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW

2094-142345-0029 DID EVER ANYBODY SEE THE LIKE SCREAMED MISSUS POYSER RUNNING TOWARDS THE TABLE WHEN HER EYE HAD FALLEN ON THE BLUE STREAM
2094-142345-0030 TOTTY HOWEVER HAD DESCENDED FROM HER CHAIR WITH GREAT SWIFTNESS AND WAS ALREADY IN RETREAT TOWARDS THE DAIRY WITH A SORT OF WADDLING RUN AND AN AMOUNT OF FAT ON THE NAPE OF HER NECK WHICH MADE HER LOOK LIKE THE METAMORPHOSIS OF A WHITE SUCKLING PIG
2094-142345-0031 AND SHE WAS VERY FOND OF YOU TOO AUNT RACHEL
2094-142345-0032 I OFTEN HEARD HER TALK OF YOU IN THE SAME SORT OF WAY
2094-142345-0033 WHEN SHE HAD THAT BAD ILLNESS AND I WAS ONLY ELEVEN YEARS OLD SHE USED TO SAY YOU'LL HAVE A FRIEND ON EARTH IN YOUR AUNT RACHEL IF I'M TAKEN FROM YOU FOR SHE HAS A KIND HEART AND I'M SURE I'VE FOUND IT SO
2094-142345-0034 AND THERE'S LINEN IN THE HOUSE AS I COULD WELL SPARE YOU FOR I'VE GOT LOTS O SHEETING AND TABLE CLOTHING AND TOWELLING AS ISN'T MADE UP
2094-142345-0035 BUT NOT MORE THAN WHAT'S IN THE BIBLE AUNT SAID DINAH
2094-142345-0036 NAY DEAR AUNT YOU NEVER HEARD ME SAY THAT ALL PEOPLE ARE CALLED TO FORSAKE THEIR WORK AND THEIR FAMILIES
2094-142345-0037 WE CAN ALL BE SERVANTS OF GOD WHEREVER OUR LOT IS CAST BUT HE GIVES US DIFFERENT SORTS OF WORK ACCORDING AS HE FITS US FOR IT AND CALLS US TO IT
2094-142345-0038 I CAN NO MORE HELP SPENDING MY LIFE IN TRYING TO DO WHAT I CAN FOR THE SOULS OF OTHERS THAN YOU COULD HELP RUNNING IF YOU HEARD LITTLE TOTTY CRYING AT THE OTHER END OF THE HOUSE THE VOICE WOULD GO TO YOUR HEART YOU WOULD THINK THE DEAR CHILD WAS IN TROUBLE OR IN DANGER AND YOU COULDN'T REST WITHOUT RUNNING TO HELP HER AND COMFORT HER
2094-142345-0039 I'VE STRONG ASSURANCE THAT NO EVIL WILL HAPPEN TO YOU AND MY UNCLE AND THE CHILDREN FROM ANYTHING I'VE DONE

2094-142345-0043 BY THIS TIME THE TWO GENTLEMEN HAD REACHED THE PALINGS AND HAD GOT DOWN FROM THEIR HORSES IT WAS PLAIN THEY MEANT TO COME IN
2094-142345-0044 SAID MISTER IRWINE WITH HIS STATELY CORDIALITY
2094-142345-0045 OH SIR DON'T MENTION IT SAID MISSUS POYSER

2094-142345-0048 SAID CAPTAIN DONNITHORNE SEATING HIMSELF WHERE HE COULD SEE ALONG THE SHORT PASSAGE TO THE OPEN DAIRY DOOR
2094-142345-0049 NO SIR HE ISN'T HE'S GONE TO ROSSETER TO SEE MISTER WEST THE FACTOR ABOUT THE WOOL

2094-142345-0059 THIS MISSUS POYSER SAID BLUSHING AND BELIEVING THAT THE CAPTAIN WAS REALLY INTERESTED IN HER MILK PANS AND WOULD ADJUST HIS OPINION OF HER TO THE APPEARANCE OF HER DAIRY
2094-142345-0060 OH I'VE NO DOUBT IT'S IN CAPITAL ORDER
