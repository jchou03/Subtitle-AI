2830-3980-0000 IN EVERY WAY THEY SOUGHT TO UNDERMINE THE AUTHORITY OF SAINT PAUL
2830-3980-0001 THEY SAID TO THE GALATIANS YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO THINK HIGHLY OF PAUL
2830-3980-0002 HE WAS THE LAST TO TURN TO CHRIST
2830-3980-0003 PAUL CAME LATER AND IS BENEATH US
2830-3980-0004 INDEED HE PERSECUTED THE CHURCH OF CHRIST FOR A LONG TIME
2830-3980-0005 DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT GOD FOR THE SAKE OF A FEW LUTHERAN HERETICS WOULD DISOWN HIS ENTIRE CHURCH
2830-3980-0006 AGAINST THESE BOASTING FALSE APOSTLES PAUL BOLDLY DEFENDS HIS APOSTOLIC AUTHORITY AND MINISTRY
2830-3980-0007 AS THE AMBASSADOR OF A GOVERNMENT IS HONORED FOR HIS OFFICE AND NOT FOR HIS PRIVATE PERSON SO THE MINISTER OF CHRIST SHOULD EXALT HIS OFFICE IN ORDER TO GAIN AUTHORITY AMONG MEN
2830-3980-0008 PAUL TAKES PRIDE IN HIS MINISTRY NOT TO HIS OWN PRAISE BUT TO THE PRAISE OF GOD
2830-3980-0009 PAUL AN APOSTLE NOT OF MEN ET CETERA
2830-3980-0010 EITHER HE CALLS MINISTERS THROUGH THE AGENCY OF MEN OR HE CALLS THEM DIRECTLY AS HE CALLED THE PROPHETS AND APOSTLES
2830-3980-0011 PAUL DECLARES THAT THE FALSE APOSTLES WERE CALLED OR SENT NEITHER BY MEN NOR BY MAN
2830-3980-0012 THE MOST THEY COULD CLAIM IS THAT THEY WERE SENT BY OTHERS
2830-3980-0013 HE MENTIONS THE APOSTLES FIRST BECAUSE THEY WERE APPOINTED DIRECTLY BY GOD
2830-3980-0014 THE CALL IS NOT TO BE TAKEN LIGHTLY
2830-3980-0015 FOR A PERSON TO POSSESS KNOWLEDGE IS NOT ENOUGH
2830-3980-0016 IT SPOILS ONE'S BEST WORK
2830-3980-0017 WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN I THOUGHT PAUL WAS MAKING TOO MUCH OF HIS CALL
2830-3980-0018 I DID NOT THEN REALIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE MINISTRY
2830-3980-0019 I KNEW NOTHING OF THE DOCTRINE OF FAITH BECAUSE WE WERE TAUGHT SOPHISTRY INSTEAD OF CERTAINTY AND NOBODY UNDERSTOOD SPIRITUAL BOASTING
2830-3980-0020 THIS IS NO SINFUL PRIDE IT IS HOLY PRIDE
2830-3980-0021 AND GOD THE FATHER WHO RAISED HIM FROM THE DEAD
2830-3980-0022 THE CLAUSE SEEMS SUPERFLUOUS ON FIRST SIGHT
2830-3980-0023 THESE PERVERTERS OF THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF CHRIST RESIST THE FATHER AND THE SON AND THE WORKS OF THEM BOTH
2830-3980-0024 IN THIS WHOLE EPISTLE PAUL TREATS OF THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST
2830-3980-0025 BY HIS RESURRECTION CHRIST WON THE VICTORY OVER LAW SIN FLESH WORLD DEVIL DEATH HELL AND EVERY EVIL
2830-3980-0026 VERSE TWO
2830-3980-0027 AND ALL THE BRETHREN WHICH ARE WITH ME
2830-3980-0028 THIS SHOULD GO FAR IN SHUTTING THE MOUTHS OF THE FALSE APOSTLES
2830-3980-0029 ALTHOUGH THE BRETHREN WITH ME ARE NOT APOSTLES LIKE MYSELF YET THEY ARE ALL OF ONE MIND WITH ME THINK WRITE AND TEACH AS I DO
2830-3980-0030 THEY DO NOT GO WHERE THE ENEMIES OF THE GOSPEL PREDOMINATE THEY GO WHERE THE CHRISTIANS ARE
2830-3980-0031 WHY DO THEY NOT INVADE THE CATHOLIC PROVINCES AND PREACH THEIR DOCTRINE TO GODLESS PRINCES BISHOPS AND DOCTORS AS WE HAVE DONE BY THE HELP OF GOD
2830-3980-0032 WE LOOK FOR THAT REWARD WHICH EYE HATH NOT SEEN NOR EAR HEARD NEITHER HATH ENTERED INTO THE HEART OF MAN
2830-3980-0033 NOT ALL THE GALATIANS HAD BECOME PERVERTED
2830-3980-0034 THESE MEANS CANNOT BE CONTAMINATED
2830-3980-0035 THEY REMAIN DIVINE REGARDLESS OF MEN'S OPINION
2830-3980-0036 WHEREVER THE MEANS OF GRACE ARE FOUND THERE IS THE HOLY CHURCH EVEN THOUGH ANTICHRIST REIGNS THERE
2830-3980-0037 SO MUCH FOR THE TITLE OF THE EPISTLE NOW FOLLOWS THE GREETING OF THE APOSTLE VERSE THREE
2830-3980-0038 GRACE BE TO YOU AND PEACE FROM GOD THE FATHER AND FROM OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST
2830-3980-0039 THE TERMS OF GRACE AND PEACE ARE COMMON TERMS WITH PAUL AND ARE NOW PRETTY WELL UNDERSTOOD
2830-3980-0040 THE GREETING OF THE APOSTLE IS REFRESHING
2830-3980-0041 GRACE INVOLVES THE REMISSION OF SINS PEACE AND A HAPPY CONSCIENCE
2830-3980-0042 THE WORLD BRANDS THIS A PERNICIOUS DOCTRINE
2830-3980-0043 EXPERIENCE PROVES THIS
2830-3980-0044 HOWEVER THE GRACE AND PEACE OF GOD WILL
2830-3980-0045 MEN SHOULD NOT SPECULATE ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD
2830-3980-0046 WAS IT NOT ENOUGH TO SAY FROM GOD THE FATHER
2830-3980-0047 TO DO SO IS TO LOSE GOD ALTOGETHER BECAUSE GOD BECOMES INTOLERABLE WHEN WE SEEK TO MEASURE AND TO COMPREHEND HIS INFINITE MAJESTY
2830-3980-0048 HE CAME DOWN TO EARTH LIVED AMONG MEN SUFFERED WAS CRUCIFIED AND THEN HE DIED STANDING CLEARLY BEFORE US SO THAT OUR HEARTS AND EYES MAY FASTEN UPON HIM
2830-3980-0049 EMBRACE HIM AND FORGET ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD
2830-3980-0050 DID NOT CHRIST HIMSELF SAY I AM THE WAY AND THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE NO MAN COMETH UNTO THE FATHER BUT BY ME
2830-3980-0051 WHEN YOU ARGUE ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD APART FROM THE QUESTION OF JUSTIFICATION YOU MAY BE AS PROFOUND AS YOU LIKE
2830-3980-0052 WE ARE TO HEAR CHRIST WHO HAS BEEN APPOINTED BY THE FATHER AS OUR DIVINE TEACHER
2830-3980-0053 AT THE SAME TIME PAUL CONFIRMS OUR CREED THAT CHRIST IS VERY GOD
2830-3980-0054 THAT CHRIST IS VERY GOD IS APPARENT IN THAT PAUL ASCRIBES TO HIM DIVINE POWERS EQUALLY WITH THE FATHER AS FOR INSTANCE THE POWER TO DISPENSE GRACE AND PEACE
2830-3980-0055 TO BESTOW PEACE AND GRACE LIES IN THE PROVINCE OF GOD WHO ALONE CAN CREATE THESE BLESSINGS THE ANGELS CANNOT
2830-3980-0056 OTHERWISE PAUL SHOULD HAVE WRITTEN GRACE FROM GOD THE FATHER AND PEACE FROM OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST
2830-3980-0057 THE ARIANS TOOK CHRIST FOR A NOBLE AND PERFECT CREATURE SUPERIOR EVEN TO THE ANGELS BECAUSE BY HIM GOD CREATED HEAVEN AND EARTH
2830-3980-0058 MOHAMMED ALSO SPEAKS HIGHLY OF CHRIST
2830-3980-0059 PAUL STICKS TO HIS THEME
2830-3980-0060 HE NEVER LOSES SIGHT OF THE PURPOSE OF HIS EPISTLE
2830-3980-0061 NOT GOLD OR SILVER OR PASCHAL LAMBS OR AN ANGEL BUT HIMSELF WHAT FOR
2830-3980-0062 NOT FOR A CROWN OR A KINGDOM OR OUR GOODNESS BUT FOR OUR SINS
2830-3980-0063 UNDERSCORE THESE WORDS FOR THEY ARE FULL OF COMFORT FOR SORE CONSCIENCES
2830-3980-0064 HOW MAY WE OBTAIN REMISSION OF OUR SINS
2830-3980-0065 PAUL ANSWERS THE MAN WHO IS NAMED JESUS CHRIST AND THE SON OF GOD GAVE HIMSELF FOR OUR SINS
2830-3980-0066 SINCE CHRIST WAS GIVEN FOR OUR SINS IT STANDS TO REASON THAT THEY CANNOT BE PUT AWAY BY OUR OWN EFFORTS
2830-3980-0067 THIS SENTENCE ALSO DEFINES OUR SINS AS GREAT SO GREAT IN FACT THAT THE WHOLE WORLD COULD NOT MAKE AMENDS FOR A SINGLE SIN
2830-3980-0068 THE GREATNESS OF THE RANSOM CHRIST THE SON OF GOD INDICATES THIS
2830-3980-0069 THE VICIOUS CHARACTER OF SIN IS BROUGHT OUT BY THE WORDS WHO GAVE HIMSELF FOR OUR SINS
2830-3980-0070 BUT WE ARE CARELESS WE MAKE LIGHT OF SIN
2830-3980-0071 WE THINK THAT BY SOME LITTLE WORK OR MERIT WE CAN DISMISS SIN
2830-3980-0072 THIS PASSAGE THEN BEARS OUT THE FACT THAT ALL MEN ARE SOLD UNDER SIN
2830-3980-0073 THIS ATTITUDE SPRINGS FROM A FALSE CONCEPTION OF SIN THE CONCEPTION THAT SIN IS A SMALL MATTER EASILY TAKEN CARE OF BY GOOD WORKS THAT WE MUST PRESENT OURSELVES UNTO GOD WITH A GOOD CONSCIENCE THAT WE MUST FEEL NO SIN BEFORE WE MAY FEEL THAT CHRIST WAS GIVEN FOR OUR SINS
2830-3980-0074 THIS ATTITUDE IS UNIVERSAL AND PARTICULARLY DEVELOPED IN THOSE WHO CONSIDER THEMSELVES BETTER THAN OTHERS
2830-3980-0075 BUT THE REAL SIGNIFICANCE AND COMFORT OF THE WORDS FOR OUR SINS IS LOST UPON THEM
2830-3980-0076 ON THE OTHER HAND WE ARE NOT TO REGARD THEM AS SO TERRIBLE THAT WE MUST DESPAIR
