4992-23283-0000 BUT THE MORE FORGETFULNESS HAD THEN PREVAILED THE MORE POWERFUL WAS THE FORCE OF REMEMBRANCE WHEN SHE AWOKE
4992-23283-0001 MISS MILNER'S HEALTH IS NOT GOOD
4992-23283-0002 SAID MISSUS HORTON A FEW MINUTES AFTER
4992-23283-0003 SO THERE IS TO ME ADDED SANDFORD WITH A SARCASTIC SNEER
4992-23283-0004 AND YET YOU MUST OWN HER BEHAVIOUR HAS WARRANTED THEM HAS IT NOT BEEN IN THIS PARTICULAR INCOHERENT AND UNACCOUNTABLE
4992-23283-0005 NOT THAT I KNOW OF NOT ONE MORE THAT I KNOW OF HE REPLIED WITH ASTONISHMENT AT WHAT SHE HAD INSINUATED AND YET WITH A PERFECT ASSURANCE THAT SHE WAS IN THE WRONG
4992-23283-0006 PERHAPS I AM MISTAKEN ANSWERED SHE
4992-23283-0007 TO ASK ANY MORE QUESTIONS OF YOU I BELIEVE WOULD BE UNFAIR
4992-23283-0008 HE SEEMED TO WAIT FOR HER REPLY BUT AS SHE MADE NONE HE PROCEEDED
4992-23283-0009 OH MY LORD CRIED MISS WOODLEY WITH A MOST FORCIBLE ACCENT YOU ARE THE LAST PERSON ON EARTH SHE WOULD PARDON ME FOR ENTRUSTING
4992-23283-0010 BUT IN SUCH A CASE MISS MILNER'S ELECTION OF A HUSBAND SHALL NOT DIRECT MINE
4992-23283-0011 IF SHE DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO ESTIMATE HER OWN VALUE I DO
4992-23283-0012 INDEPENDENT OF HER FORTUNE SHE HAS BEAUTY TO CAPTIVATE THE HEART OF ANY MAN AND WITH ALL HER FOLLIES SHE HAS A FRANKNESS IN HER MANNER AN UNAFFECTED WISDOM IN HER THOUGHTS A VIVACITY IN HER CONVERSATION AND WITHAL A SOFTNESS IN HER DEMEANOUR THAT MIGHT ALONE ENGAGE THE AFFECTIONS OF A MAN OF THE NICEST SENTIMENTS AND THE STRONGEST UNDERSTANDING
4992-23283-0013 MY LORD MISS MILNER'S TASTE IS NOT A DEPRAVED ONE IT IS BUT TOO REFINED
4992-23283-0014 WHAT CAN YOU MEAN BY THAT MISS WOODLEY YOU TALK MYSTERIOUSLY
4992-23283-0015 IS SHE NOT AFRAID THAT I WILL THWART HER INCLINATIONS
4992-23283-0016 AGAIN HE SEARCHED HIS OWN THOUGHTS NOR INEFFECTUALLY AS BEFORE
4992-23283-0017 MISS WOODLEY WAS TOO LITTLE VERSED IN THE SUBJECT TO KNOW THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN NOT TO LOVE AT ALL AT LEAST NOT TO THE EXTENT OF BREAKING THROUGH ENGAGEMENTS AND ALL THE VARIOUS OBSTACLES THAT STILL MILITATED AGAINST THEIR UNION
4992-23283-0018 TO RELIEVE HER FROM BOTH HE LAID HIS HAND WITH FORCE UPON HIS HEART AND SAID DO YOU BELIEVE ME
4992-23283-0019 I WILL MAKE NO UNJUST USE OF WHAT I KNOW HE REPLIED WITH FIRMNESS I BELIEVE YOU MY LORD
4992-23283-0020 I HAVE NEVER YET HOWEVER BEEN VANQUISHED BY THEM AND EVEN UPON THIS OCCASION MY REASON SHALL COMBAT THEM TO THE LAST AND MY REASON SHALL FAIL ME BEFORE I DO WRONG
