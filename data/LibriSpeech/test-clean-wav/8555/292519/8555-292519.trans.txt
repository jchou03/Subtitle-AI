8555-292519-0000 BRIGHTER THAN EARLY DAWN'S MOST BRILLIANT DYE ARE BLOWN CLEAR BANDS OF COLOR THROUGH THE SKY THAT SWIRL AND SWEEP AND MEET TO BREAK AND FOAM LIKE RAINBOW VEILS UPON A BUBBLE'S DOME
8555-292519-0001 GUIDED BY YOU HOW WE MIGHT STROLL TOWARDS DEATH OUR ONLY MUSIC ONE ANOTHER'S BREATH THROUGH GARDENS INTIMATE WITH HOLLYHOCKS WHERE SILENT POPPIES BURN BETWEEN THE ROCKS BY POOLS WHERE BIRCHES BEND TO CONFIDANTS ABOVE GREEN WATERS SCUMMED WITH LILY PLANTS
8555-292519-0002 VENICE
8555-292519-0003 IN A SUNSET GLOWING OF CRIMSON AND GOLD SHE LIES THE GLORY OF THE WORLD A BEACHED KING'S GALLEY WHOSE SAILS ARE FURLED WHO IS HUNG WITH TAPESTRIES RICH AND OLD
8555-292519-0004 THE PITY THAT WE MUST COME AND GO
8555-292519-0005 WHILE THE OLD GOLD AND THE MARBLE STAYS FOREVER GLEAMING ITS SOFT STRONG BLAZE CALM IN THE EARLY EVENING GLOW
8555-292519-0006 THE PLEASANT GRAVEYARD OF MY SOUL WITH SENTIMENTAL CYPRESS TREES AND FLOWERS IS FILLED THAT I MAY STROLL IN MEDITATION AT MY EASE
8555-292519-0007 IT IS MY HEART HUNG IN THE SKY AND NO CLOUDS EVER FLOAT BETWEEN THE GRAVE FLOWERS AND MY HEART ON HIGH
8555-292519-0008 OVER THE TRACK LINED CITY STREET THE YOUNG MEN THE GRINNING MEN PASS
8555-292519-0009 HO YE SAILS THAT SEEM TO WANDER IN DREAM FILLED MEADOWS SAY IS THE SHORE WHERE I STAND THE ONLY FIELD OF STRUGGLE OR ARE YE HIT AND BATTERED OUT THERE BY WAVES AND WIND GUSTS AS YE TACK OVER A CLASHING SEA OF WATERY ECHOES
8555-292519-0010 OLD DANCES ARE SIMPLIFIED OF THEIR YEARNING BLEACHED BY TIME
8555-292519-0011 HE HAD GOT INTO HER COURTYARD
8555-292519-0012 THROUGH THE BLACK NIGHT RAIN HE SANG TO HER WINDOW BARS
8555-292519-0013 THAT WAS BUT RUSTLING OF DRIPPING PLANTS IN THE DARK
8555-292519-0014 SHE WAS ALONE THAT NIGHT
8555-292519-0015 HE HAD BROKEN INTO HER COURTYARD
